  * Deviance, Conformity, and Social Control in Canada is a broad, critical introduction to the study of deviance. Theories are covered in two early chapters, and Bereska then devotes the rest of the text to substantive issues of particular interest to students. These chapters present topics that arise in everyday situations that are relevant to students’ lives, and include new sections on youth, science and physical appearance. Each topic is placed within a socio-cultural context and contributes to a bigger picture. Both criminal and non-criminal forms of deviance are discussed in each chapter, and the role of power in the social construction of deviance explored.
